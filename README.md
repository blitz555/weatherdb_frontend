## the WeatherDB - A weather database for cities around the world

The WeatherDB is a data visualization application for historical weather data. New data is collected daily from a third-party API (AerisWeather) and saved in the data base. These statistics currently include daily max/min temperature, UV index, precipitation. This data visualization tool helps to identify trends in weather data due to climate change, which may be affecting some areas of the world differently from others.
